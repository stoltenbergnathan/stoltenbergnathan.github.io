# My Personal Website
A very simple website with one html [file](./index.html), one css [file](./index.css), and one JS [file](./index.js).

# Running
The website is deployed using github pages, but can be ran locally using LiveServer with VScode, or by serving it with any backend framework.

# External Sources
I used [toperkin's](https://github.com/toperkin/staticFormEmails/blob/master/README.md) README on static contact forms to help create the contact form for my page
